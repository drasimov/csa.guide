## Welcome to the CSA Guide

Welcome to Top Tips for AP Computer Science A!

In this website, we will guide you, through a series of examples, to write trash code, or turn your current code to trash.
Hopefully, you already know how to write the following:

```java
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
         System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
