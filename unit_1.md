## Primitive: 
- Just value, nothing else. int, double, boolean are all primitives  
---
## Data type casting 
- Operators (int) and (double) can temporarily cast a value to a different data type to allow it to be stored in different variables
- (int) 3.1415 => 3
- (double) 3 => 3.0
- Rounding-to-nearest-int formula for doubles
- (int)(x + 0.5) for positive x and (int)(x – 0.5) for negative x
