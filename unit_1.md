## Primitive: 
- Just value, nothing else. int, double, boolean are all primitives  
---
## Data type casting 
- Operators (int) and (double) can temporarily cast a value to a different data type to allow it to be stored in different variables
- (int) 3.1415 => 3
- (double) 3 => 3.0
- Rounding-to-nearest-int formula for doubles
- (int)(x + 0.5) for positive x and (int)(x – 0.5) for negative x

## Some Notes to Refer to:
  ### Variables and data types:
    - int=integer=5
    - double=decimals=5.0
    - char=characters='A'
    - boolean=true/false=true
    - These data types could also be a storage box that is used to store data of its declared type programs need to be declared. e.g. in (declare data type) numApples (variable name);
    - variable names must start with a letter, $, or _
    - use lowerCamelCase
    - variables are case sensitive
    - data type in declaration must match the assigned value type
