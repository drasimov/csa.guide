# AP CS A Unit One: Primitive Data Types and Casting
## 1. Primitive Data Types
### Definition
Primitive data types in Java are fundamental data types that store simple values directly in memory. Unlike objects, they lack methods or properties and represent raw data. In AP Computer Science A (AP CS A) Unit 1, the primary focus is on `int`, `double`, and `boolean`, though other primitive types exist in Java.
### Core Types for AP CS A
- **`int`**: A 32-bit integer representing whole numbers, with a range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 ($$-2^{31}$$ to $$2^{31}-1$$). Suitable for discrete values like AP scores.
  - Example: `int apScore = 5;`
- **`double`**: A 64-bit floating-point number for decimal values, ideal for precise calculations such as grade point averages (GPAs).
  - Example: `double gpa = 4.0;`
- **`boolean`**: A logical type with values `true` or `false`, used for conditions like enrollment status.
  - Example: `boolean isEnrolled = true;`
### Extended Primitive Types
Beyond AP CS A’s core types, Java includes additional primitive types useful for specific scenarios:
- **`byte`**: An 8-bit integer with a range of -128 to 127. Useful for small counts, such as the number of AP exams taken.
  - Example: `byte apExamsTaken = 3;`
- **`short`**: A 16-bit integer with a range of -32,768 to 32,767. Suitable for intermediate counts, like total students in a school.
  - Example: `short totalStudents = 1500;`
- **`char`**: A 16-bit Unicode character representing a single character, such as a letter grade.
  - Example: `char gradeLetter = 'A';`
- **`long`**: A 64-bit integer with a range of approximately -9 quintillion to 9 quintillion ($$-2^{63}$$ to $$2^{63}-1$$). Used for large values, like a cumulative academic record ID.
  - Example: `long studentId = 123456789012L;` (Note the `L` suffix for `long` literals.)
- **`float`**: A 32-bit floating-point number for decimals with less precision than `double`. Useful for less critical decimal calculations, like temporary GPA estimates.
  - Example: `float tempGpa = 3.85f;` (Note the `f` suffix for `float` literals.)
### Key Notes
- Primitive types are stored in stack memory, ensuring efficiency for simple operations compared to reference types (e.g., `String`), which store references in the stack and data in the heap.
- Variables must be declared with their type before use, e.g., `int apScore = 5;`.
- AP CS A emphasizes `int`, `double`, and `boolean`, but understanding other types enhances versatility in programming.
### Example Program
```java
public class AcademicProfile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Core AP CS A types
        int apScore = 5;// AP exam score
        double gpa = 4.0;// Grade point average
        boolean isEnrolled = true; // Enrollment status
        // Extended types
        byte apExamsTaken = 3;// Number of AP exams
        short totalStudents = 1500;// Total students in school
        char gradeLetter = 'A';// Letter grade
        long studentId = 123456789012L;// Unique student ID
        float tempGpa = 3.85f;// Temporary GPA estimate
        System.out.println("Student Profile:");
        System.out.println("AP Score: " + apScore);
        System.out.println("GPA: " + gpa);
        System.out.println("Enrolled: " + isEnrolled);
        System.out.println("Exams Taken: " + apExamsTaken);
        System.out.println("Total Students: " + totalStudents);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + gradeLetter);
        System.out.println("Student ID: " + studentId);
        System.out.println("Temporary GPA: " + tempGpa);
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```
Student Profile:
AP Score: 5
GPA: 4.0
Enrolled: true
Exams Taken: 3
Total Students: 1500
Grade: A
Student ID: 123456789012
Temporary GPA: 3.85
```
### Common Errors
- **Overflow**: Assigning a value beyond a type’s range causes errors. Example: `byte apExams = 128;` exceeds `byte`’s range.
- **Incorrect Type Assignment**: Assigning a `double` to an `int` without casting fails. Example: `int gpa = 4.0;` requires `(int)`.
- **Missing Suffix**: Omitting `L` for `long` or `f` for `float` literals causes compilation errors. Example: `float tempGpa = 3.85;` needs `f`.

## 2. Data Type Casting
### Definition
Type casting converts a value from one primitive data type to another. In AP CS A, casting is essential when mixing types in calculations or formatting outputs, such as converting a `double` GPA to an `int` score.
### Types of Casting
1. **Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion)**:
   - Automatically converts a smaller or less precise type to a larger or more precise type (e.g., `int` to `double`).
   - No data loss occurs.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int apScore = 5;
     double scoreAsDouble = apScore; // Implicitly converts to 5.0
     System.out.println(scoreAsDouble); // Output: 5.0
     ```
2. **Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion)**:
   - Manually converts a larger or more precise type to a smaller or less precise type (e.g., `double` to `int`).
   - Uses the cast operator, e.g., `(int)`.
   - May cause data loss, such as truncating decimals.
   - Examples:
     ```java
     double gpa = 3.95;
     int truncatedGpa = (int) gpa; // Truncates to 3
     System.out.println(truncatedGpa); // Output: 3
     ```
     ```java
     int exams = 3;
     float examsAsFloat = (float) exams; // Converts to 3.0f
     System.out.println(examsAsFloat); // Output: 3.0
     ```
### Key Rules
- **Syntax**: Use `(targetType)` before the value, e.g., `(int)(gpa)`.
- **Truncation**: Casting `double` or `float` to `int` discards decimals (e.g., `(int) 3.95` yields `3`).
- **No `boolean` Casting**: `boolean` cannot be cast to or from other types.
- **Extended Types**: Casting applies to all primitives (e.g., `long` to `int`, `float` to `double`), but narrowing conversions risk data loss.
### Rounding Doubles to Nearest Integer
To round a `double` to the nearest integer (instead of truncating):
- **Positive Numbers**: `(int)(x + 0.5)`
  - Example: `(int)(3.95 + 0.5)` → `(int)(4.45)` → `4`
- **Negative Numbers**: `(int)(x - 0.5)`
  - Example: `(int)(-3.95 - 0.5)` → `(int)(-4.45)` → `-4`
### Example Program
```java
public class AcademicCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Core type casting
        double gpa = 3.95;
        int truncatedGpa = (int) gpa; // Truncates to 3
        int roundedGpa = (int)(gpa + 0.5); // Rounds to 4
        int apScore = 5;
        double scoreAsDouble = apScore; // Implicitly 5.0
        // Extended type casting
        long studentId = 123456789012L;
        int shortId = (int) studentId; // Narrows, may lose data
        float tempGpa = 3.85f;
        double preciseGpa = tempGpa; // Widens to double
        System.out.println("Truncated GPA: " + truncatedGpa);
        System.out.println("Rounded GPA: " + roundedGpa);
        System.out.println("AP Score as Double: " + scoreAsDouble);
        System.out.println("Shortened Student ID: " + shortId);
        System.out.println("Precise GPA: " + preciseGpa);
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```
Truncated GPA: 3
Rounded GPA: 4
AP Score as Double: 5.0
Shortened Student ID: 1665732
Precise GPA: 3.8499999046325684
```
### Common Errors
- **Missing Cast**: Narrowing conversions require explicit casting. Example: `int gpa = 3.95;` fails without `(int)`.
- **Rounding Errors**: Using the positive rounding formula for negative numbers yields incorrect results. Example: `(int)(-3.95 + 0.5)` → `-3` (should be `-4`).
- **Overflow in Narrowing**: Casting a `long` to `int` may produce unexpected results if the value exceeds `int`’s range.

## 3. Connection to AP CS A Unit 1
### Curriculum Context
AP CS A Unit 1 introduces Java programming fundamentals, including:
- **Variables and Data Types**: Declaring and using `int`, `double`, and `boolean` to represent academic data like scores and GPAs.
- **Basic Operations**: Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) often require casting for mixed types (e.g., averaging `int` scores as a `double`).
- **Input/Output**: Using `System.out.println` to display results, sometimes requiring casting for formatting.
- **Program Structure**: Writing `main` methods and simple programs to process academic data.
### Relevance of Casting
- Casting is critical for calculations involving mixed types, such as computing a GPA from integer scores.
- It facilitates formatting output (e.g., truncating a `double` GPA for display).
- Rounding techniques are practical for real-world applications, like converting GPAs to integer scales.
### Practice Questions
1. **Code Tracing**: What is the output of this code?
   ```java
   double gpa = 4.45;
   int roundedGpa = (int)(gpa + 0.5);
   System.out.println(roundedGpa);
   ```
   **Answer**: `4`
2. **Error Identification**: Why does this code fail?
   ```java
   float tempGpa = 3.85;
   int gpa = tempGpa;
   ```
   **Answer**: A `float` cannot be assigned to an `int` without explicit casting. Correct: `int$gpa = (int) tempGpa;`.
3. **Coding Exercise**: Write a program that takes a `double` GPA and rounds it to the nearest integer, handling positive and negative inputs correctly.

## 4. Additional Notes
### Best Practices
- Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `apScore` instead of `x`) to enhance readability.
- Comment complex casting or rounding logic for clarity.
- Test edge cases (e.g., `0.5`, `-0.5`, large `long` values) to ensure robustness.
### Extensions
- The `Math` class provides methods like `Math.round`, `Math.floor`, and `Math.ceil` for advanced rounding, introduced later in AP CS A.
- Casting affects arithmetic: `(double) 5 / 2` yields `2.5`, while `5 / 2` yields `2`.
- Extended types like `char` can be used for letter grades, and `long` for unique identifiers, expanding the scope of academic applications.
